        <p>Hello! I'm Tyler, as you may have read above. I like to sing and play instruments in my spare time. My favorite thing to do is to write songs.
        I'm also really into technology. I like coding for video games and making robots with my little brother. </p>
        <h2>How I got my start</h2>
        <p>My first introduction to coding was a java class I took online when I was 14. I made a couple of the beginner programs like a calculater and a few other
        console applications. Soon after, I began experimenting with this program called Blender. Blender uses Python and I used it to make little survival type video games.</p>
        <p>Fast foward a few years later, I'm now 18 and I decide to go to grand circus for the C# full stack bootcamp. I feel like a did really well during the bootcamp,
        getting good project reviews and turning in all my projects on time. I wasn't ready for a career yet though. Now 22, I'm ready to enter into the workforce and aquire
        some new front-end skills!</p>
